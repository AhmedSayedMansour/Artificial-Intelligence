On one bank of a river are 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals. There is one boat available that can hold up to two people and that they would like to use to cross the river. If the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either of the river’s banks, the missionaries will get eaten.How can the boat be used to safely carry all the missionaries and cannibals across the river?

notes:- There is one boat available that can hold up to two people
(the boat can not move from left to right or from right to left alone without Missionaries or Cannibals).
